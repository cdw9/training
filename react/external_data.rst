Using External Data
===================

Creating A Simple Backend
=========================

In order to persist our data we will create a backend to fetch our initial data.
We will use :file:`express` to create a simple server. To install type:

.. code-block:: console

    $ yarn add express

Now we'll create a simple server in the file :file:`server.js`

::

    const express = require("express");
    const app = express();
    const port = 3001;

    const faq = [
      {
        question: "What does the Plone Foundation do?",
        answer: "The mission of the Plone Foundation is to protect and..."
      },
      {
        question: "Why does Plone need a Foundation?",
        answer: "Plone has reached critical mass, with enterprise..."
      }
    ];

    app.get("/", (req, res) => {
      res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
      res.json(faq);
    });

    app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Listening on port: ${port}`));

Then we can run our newly created server:

.. code-block:: console

    $ node server.js

Now it's time to write our action to fetch the items from the backend:

::

    export const getFaqItems = () => ({
      type: "GET_FAQ_ITEMS",
      request: {
        op: "get",
        path: "/"
      }
    });

Writing Middleware
==================

Since the action itself doesn't do any api call we will create middleware to
do the job. Redux middleware is a simple method which receives the store, the
method to call the next action and the action itself. The middleware can then
decide to do something based on the data in the action. In our case we are
looking for a property called :file:`request`. If that one is available we want
to do an api call with the provided operation, path and data and fire a new a
new action when the data is fetched. The implementation will look like this:

::

    export default store => next => action => {
      const { request, type, ...rest } = action;

      if (!request) {
        return next(action);
      }

      next({ ...rest, type: `${type}_PENDING` });

      const actionPromise = fetch(`http://localhost:3001${request.path}`, {
        method: request.op,
        body: request.data && JSON.stringify(request.data)
      });

      actionPromise.then(response => {
        response.json().then(data => next({ data, type: `${type}_SUCCESS` }));
      });

      return actionPromise;
    };

Finally we need to apply our middleware to the store:

::

    import React, { Component } from "react";
    import { Provider } from "react-redux";
    import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from "redux";

    import rootReducer from "./reducers";
    import Faq from "./components/Faq";
    import api from "./middleware/api";

    import "./App.css";

    const store = createStore(rootReducer, applyMiddleware(api));

    class App extends Component {
      render() {
        return (
          <Provider store={store}>
            <Faq />
          </Provider>
        );
      }
    }

    export default App;
